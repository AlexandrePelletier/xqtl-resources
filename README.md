## Dataset Categories

### Study Information (6 datasets)

- [Knight-ADRC study info](https://github.com/StatFunGen/xqtl-resources/tree/main/content/xqtl-data/study_info/KnightADRC.md): The Memory and Aging Project at the Charles F. And Joanne Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Knight-ADRC at Washington University in St. Louis) collects collects plasma, CSF, fibroblast, neuroimaging  clinical and cognition data longitudinally and autopsied brain samples. This clinical information combined with deep molecular phenotyping (i.e. genetic, proteomics, transcriptomics and others) will lead to the identification of novel genetic modifiers, protective variants, molecular biomarkers and the novel targets. Participants were recruited by the Knight-ADRC at Washington University in St. Louis (MO). Knight-ADRC participants have to be at least 65 years old and have no memory problems or mild dementia at the time of enrollment.

Hussman Institute for Human Genomics (HIHG) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (Miami, FL), North Carolina A&T State University (Greensboro, NC), and Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH).  Participants were ascertained as part of the ADSP Follow-up Study and included both cases (>65 years of age of onset) and controls (>65 years of age at age of exam).  All participants were adjudicated by a clinical panel with expertise in AD related disorders and classified as AD according to standard criteria developed by the National Institute of Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association.
