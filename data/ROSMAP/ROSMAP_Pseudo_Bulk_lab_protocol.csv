We observed variability in the morphology of these tissue specimens with differing amounts of gray and white matter and presence of attached meninges. Working on ice throughout, we carefully dissected to remove white matter and meninges, when present. The following steps were also conducted on ice: about 50-100mg of gray matter tissue was transferred into the dounce homogenizer (Sigma Cat No: D8938) with 2mL of NP40 Lysis Buffer [0.1% NP40, 10mM Tris, 146mM NaCl, 1mM CaCl2, 21mM MgCl2, 40U/mL of RNAse inhibitor (Takara: 2313B)]. Tissue was gently dounced while on ice 25 times with Pestle A followed by 25 times with Pestle B, then transferred to a 15mL conical tube. 3mL of PBS + 0.01% BSA (NEB B9000S) and 40U/mL of RNAse inhibitor were added for a final volume of 5mL and then immediately centrifuged with a swing bucket rotor at 500g for 5 mins at 4°C.
