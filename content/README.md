# FunGen-AD Resources

## About FunGen-AD

The **[Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project Functional Genomics Consortium (FunGen-AD)](https://adsp-fgc.niagads.org/)** is a collaborative initiative aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease through multi-omic and genetic screening approaches.

## Available Resources

### FunGen-xQTL

The FunGen-xQTL project provides comprehensive molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses across multiple molecular phenotypes:

* **[xQTL Analysis and xQTL-GWAS Integration Results](xqtl_resource_description)** along with **[File Format Description](xqtl_resource_format)**
* **[Study Cohorts](xqtl-data/study_info/)** - Information about participating cohorts including ROSMAP, Knight ADRC, MSBB, MiGA, MAGENTA, and STARNET
* **[GWAS Summary Statistics](xqtl-data/gwas/)** - Alzheimer's disease GWAS data from major studies (Bellenguez, Kunkle, Wightman, Jansen)
* **[Molecular Phenotypes](xqtl-data/omics/)** - Multi-omic data including:
  - Chromatin accessibility 
  - Histone modification
  - DNA methylation
  - Gene expression (bulk RNA-seq, single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq)
  - Alternative splicing (bulk RNA-seq, single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq)g
  - Proteomics
  - Metabolomics
* **[xQTL Data](xqtl-data/qtl/)** - Molecular QTL associations across brain regions, cell types, and molecular phenotypes
* **[Reference Data](xqtl-data/reference_data/)** - LD reference panels and other analytical resources

Software resources implementing the xQTL analysis are also available:

* **[xQTL Analysis Protocol](https://statfungen.github.io/xqtl-protocol)** - Standardized computational protocols for QTL detection and analysis
* **[xQTL Companion Statistical Methods Implementation](https://github.com/StatFunGen/pecotmr)** - Fine-mapping, enrichment, colocalization, TWAS, and Mendelian randomization tools

## Data Access

All datasets are available through controlled access via:
- [Synapse Platform](https://www.synapse.org/) (primary repository)
- [NIAGADS](https://www.niagads.org/) (genomics data)
