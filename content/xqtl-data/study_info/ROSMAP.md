# ROSMAP study info

Religious Orders Study (ROS) or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) study: ROS is a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) run from Rush University that enrolled individuals from religious communities for longitudinal clinical analysis and brain donation. Participants were enrolled from more than 40 groups of religious orders (nuns, priests, brothers) across the United States. MAP is a longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical-pathologic cohort study of common chronic conditions of aging with an emphasis on decline in cognitive and motor function and risk of Alzheimer’s disease that began in 1997 and is run from Rush University.

Above is a raw ROSMAP metadata contains comprehensive covariate information and the codebook explaining each column. Other than Age at death, Sex and PMI often use in our xQTL analysis, there are also interesting covariates for investigation such as education level, emotional neglect and Financial need etc.
