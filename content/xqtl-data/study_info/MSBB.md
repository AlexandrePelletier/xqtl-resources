- Study name : The Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) study
- Study Description : Brain specimens were obtained from the Mount Sinai/JJ Peters VA Medical Center Brain Bank (MSBB) which holds over 1,700 samples. This cohort was assembled after applying stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria and represents the full spectrum of disease severity. Neuropathological assessments are performed according to the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) protocol and include assessment by hematoxylin and eosin, modified Bielschowski, modified thioflavin S, and anti-β amyloid (4G8), anti-tau (AD2) and anti-ubiquitin (Daka Corp.). Each case is assigned a Braak AD-staging score for progression of neurofibrillary neuropathology. Quantitative data regarding the density of neuritic plaques in the middle frontal gyrus, orbital frontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal cortex and calcarine cortex are also collected as described. Clinical dementia rating scale (CDR) and mini–mental state examination (MMSE) severity tests are conducted for assessment of dementia and cognitive status. Final diagnoses and CDR scores are conferred by consensus. Based on CDR classification, subjects are grouped as no cognitive deficits (CDR = 0), questionable dementia (CDR = 0.5), mild dementia (CDR = 1.0), moderate dementia (CDR = 2.0), and severe to terminal dementia (CDR = 3.0–5.0). Covariates including demographic and neuropathological data were collected on the samples used for this project including postmortem interval, race, age of death, clinical dementia rating, clinical neuropathology diagnosis, CERAD, Braak, sex, and a series of neuropathological variables.
