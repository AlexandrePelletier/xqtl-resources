# STARNET 

STARNET is an RNA expression study of various disease-relevant tissues obtained from living patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The inclusion criterion for patients was eligibility for coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) surgery. 

Further information about the STARNET patients:

***Northern European Caucasian :*** 31% FEMALE, 32% have diabetes, 75% have hypertension, 67% have hyperlipidemia, 33% had myocardial infarction before age 60.
