# MAGENTA study info
Multi-Ancestry Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics of Alzheimer’s (MAGENTA) Project: Participants include 465 individuals (AA – 113 with AD, 118 cognitively intact controls; NHW – 116 with AD, 118 controls) ascertained by the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics (HIHG) at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (Miami, FL), North Carolina A&T State University (Greensboro, NC), and Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland, OH).  Participants were ascertained as part of the ADSP Follow-up Study and included both cases (>65 years of age of onset) and controls (>65 years of age at age of exam).  All participants were adjudicated by a clinical panel with expertise in AD related disorders and classified as AD according to standard criteria developed by the National Institute of Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association.

- Study name : Multi-Ancestry Genomics, Epigenomics, and Transcriptomics of Alzheimer’s (MAGENTA) Project
- Study Description : MAGENTA is a cross-sectional study of Alzheimer’s disease that includes multiple ancestry groups.  Using whole-blood as a source tissue, bulk RNA-seq and DNA methylation array data were generated and combined with existing genome-wide genotyping and whole-genome sequencing data.  This study was designed to examine differences in -omics profiles between AD cases and controls by ancestry, and to discover eQTL and mQTL variants associated with AD outcomes.
