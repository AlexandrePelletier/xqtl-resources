## Data Descriptions

**Verifying current avaliable location for the dataset now**

Samples were extracted using Qiagen's miRNeasy mini kit (cat. no. 217004) and the RNase free DNase Set (cat. no. 79254), and quantified by Nanodrop and quality was evaluated by Agilent Bioanalyzer.

| Brain      | Description |
| -----------| ----------- |
| Batch 1    | 638         |
| Batch 2    | 252 (117 for PolyA selection & 135 for rRNA depletion)        |
| Batch 3    | 251         |
| Total      | 1141        |

**Notes regarding sample naming:** Sequencing samples that were sequenced more than once include the sequencing batch number as the last 2 digits of the id. For example, sample 123_456789_02 is sample "123_456789", from batch 2. The sample IDs are otherwise randomly-assigned identifiers. Some samples were re-sequenced due to poor quality or low output, they may have "redo" in the sample identifier.

### Results

In this analysis we performed two methods: leafcutter and psichomics.

#### leafcutter

- Output summary statistics are uploaded to the FTP server: `/ftp_fgc_xqtl/projects/rna-seq/BU/ROSMAP_DLPFC/sQTL/association_scan/`

#### psichomics

- data generation using psichomics still in progress
