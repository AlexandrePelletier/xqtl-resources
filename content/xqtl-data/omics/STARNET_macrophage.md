# STARNET macrophage gene expression QTL

STARNET is an RNA expression study of various disease-relevant tissues obtained from living patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The inclusion criterion for patients was eligibility for coronary artery by-pass graft (CABG) surgery.

Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/cumc/fungen-xqtl-analysis/tree/main/analysis/Marcora_MSSM/STARNET) for an overview of the STARNET project.

## Dataset Description

### Raw Data

Macrophage RNA-Seq:

RNA was purified from whole blood with the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For tissue biopsies, RNA was isolated as described (36, 37). DNA was isolated from whole blood with the QIAmp DNA Blood Midi kit (Qiagen). DNA and RNA qualities were assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Samples RIN scores of >7 were accepted for RNA-seq.Sequencing libraries were prepared with the Illumina TruSeq stranded mRNA kit, the Ribo-Zero method, and Illumina TruSeq nonstranded mRNA kit with poly(A)+ selection. Samples were sequenced using the Human OmniExpressExome-8v1 bead chip via the Illumina Infinium Assay.

### Molecular Phenotype Matrices

Data Processing:

The STARNET FASTQ files (paired-end, 50 - 100 bp) were processed using the ADGC FGC xQTL pipeline. In brief, the FASTQ files had their adaptors removed using fastp. These trimmed FASTQ files were aligned with the GRCh38 human reference genome using STAR with default parameters. Picard was then used to identify duplicate reads. RNA-SeQC was used to carry out post-alignment QC and RNA quantification, again using default parameters. RSEM was used to generate the expression matrix from the STAR output.
